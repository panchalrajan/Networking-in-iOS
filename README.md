# Networking-in-iOS

In this Project, I made a NetworkManager Class which sends GET and POST Request using a Model to an API
Also Implemented an ImageDownloader which downloads the images from server and save it to User's Gallery
And a Dynamic ViewController which takes optional Character and make viewcontroller to add or edit user details
